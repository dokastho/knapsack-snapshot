# knapsack-snapshot
The purpose of this repository is to demonstrate my understanding of algorithm complexity, merge sort, and the greedy algorithm by writing a smart knapsack problem solver. Given a random 0-1 knapsack problem, this program will find an easily computable and efficient solution given a time constraint (O(nlognlogC)) by attempting both a capacity- and ratio-based greedy solution. Both of these attempted solutions run in the desired runtime complexity, which means it's trivially acceptable to attempt both types and return the one with the more optimal solution.
